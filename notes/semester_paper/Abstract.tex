\chapter*{Abstract}

Incomplete or missing data are common in scientific works, and the most common
solution to cope with them is the simply to discard them. However, this might
lead to bias in the conclusion. This semester paper summaries modern methods
and offers an empirical comparison of the packages \emph{amelia},
\emph{imputeknn}, \emph{mi}, \emph{mice}, \emph{softimpute} with the
statistical software R.
